## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/percept-ui.git
cd percept-ui/package
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CuriousCoder00/percept-ui.git
```

3. Synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

4. Install dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install
```


5. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b my-bug-fix
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```
7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/CuriousCoder00/percept-ui/pulls) and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.
